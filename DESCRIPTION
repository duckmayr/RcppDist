Description: The Rcpp package provides a C++ library to make it easier
    to use C++ with R. R and Rcpp provide functions for a variety of
    statistical distributions. Several R packages make functions
    available to R for additional statistical distributions. However,
    to access these functions from C++ code, a costly call to the R
    functions must be made. RcppDist provides a C++ library with
    functions for additional statistical distributions that can be
    called from C++ when writing code using Rcpp or RcppArmadillo.
    Functions are available that return NumericVectors as well as
    doubles, and for multivariate or matrix distributions, Armadillo
    vectors and matrices. RcppDist provides functions for the following
    distributions: the four parameter beta distribution; the location-
    scale t distribution; the truncated normal distribution; the
    truncated t distribution; a truncated location-scale t distribution;
    the triangle distribution; the multivariate normal distribution*;
    the multivariate t distribution*; the Wishart distribution*; and
    the inverse Wishart distribution*. Distributions marked with an
    asterisk rely on RcppArmadillo.
